# Compass Real Estates
#### first project for Code Institute

### Project goal
Create responsive page using HTML and CSS

### About
Compass Real Estates is an imaginary company specialising in elite estates around the world.

##### Idea
As I didn't had an inspiration for the website, I used random word generator to come up with the name of the project, and keywords

Fake number generator is used to create valid looking contact numbers on the bottom of the index page 


### Styling
There are two CSS files, mostly because it looks cleaner that way, at least for me:


*style.css - takes care of the layout

*my-class.css - fine tuning classes

### Demo
[Compass Real Estates](https://azelliott.github.io/compass-real-estate/)

### Site navigation
#### Index page consists of sticky navigation with links, about section containing card elements and contact footer
