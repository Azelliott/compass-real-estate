# This is my first project for Code Institute

### Project goal
Create responsive page using HTML and CSS

### About
Compass Real Estates is an imaginary company specializing in elite estates around the world.

I used random word generator to come up with the name of the project, and keywords
Fake number generator is used to create contact numbers on the index page 

For styling, there are two CSS files, mostly because it looks cleaner that way at least for me
style.css - takes care of the layout
my-class.css - fine tuning classes

### Site 
Main index page consists of sticky navigation with links, about section containing card elements and contact footer
