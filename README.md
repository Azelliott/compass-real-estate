## Idea

This was an excercise to create a site with as little information as possible. Random word generator was used to come up with the name of the project (company) and few keywords. Entire project was built out from that.

On the bottom of the index page, fake number generator is used to create valid contact numbers from different continents. 


## Styling
There are two CSS files, mostly because it looks cleaner that way, at least for me:

* style.css - takes care of the layout

* my-class.css - fine tuning classes
